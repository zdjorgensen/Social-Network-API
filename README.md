  ## Description

  For challenge 18 `Social Network API` I created a mongodb directory that stores users, thoughts, and reactions as a way to resemble a working social media website. I struggled getting the reactions to work and it took a while to understand the different functions like `$set`, `$addToSet`, `$pull`, `findOneAndUpdate`. It was interesting to use functions like these as they simplified some aspects but complicated others and without the help of Google or `mongoosejs.com` I doubt I could have understood what each function did or how to call them. While working on this challenge I used previous Zoom recordings, previous calls activities, and Google complete this challenge. 

  When the user starts the application in the command line, they are able to use `Insomnia` to get, create, update, and delete users, thoughts, reactions, and friends to create a basic social media network. This social media database tracks the user's username, email, their thoughts, other user's who are their friends, and reactions to thoughts that the user created. This database could be used as a proof of concept for how a social media website could be set up on the backend.
